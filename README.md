In this capstone project, one learns how to collect data from scratch.I used BeautifulSoup library for web scraping.So, I learned how srape web data and parse it using HTML code in situations where the data is not readily avaialable.It uses the location data for Toronto and RESTful API'S such as the FourSquare API to make API calls.This project demonstrates how to make RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world.Then, I used python and it's libraries to convert the data into a dataframe,manipulate it and use k-means clustering.Finally,I used the Folium library to create maps to show my results.
